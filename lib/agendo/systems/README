# Agendo::Systems

===========================================
	General Organization
-------------------------------------------
Agendo is comprised of multiple interacting systems.
Each system has been separated out into its own service/application.

===========================================
	Gemsets
-------------------------------------------
Each Agendo sub-system has its own Gemset.
These system-specific Gemsets are prefaced by 'agendo' followed by the name as the sub-system they support.

Eg. The 'useraccounts' sub-system uses gemset 'agendo_useraccounts'.

These sub-system specific Gemsets prototypically inherit from the 'agendo' gemset.
